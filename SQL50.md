### Recyclable and Low Fat Products

Table: `Products`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
```

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Find the names of the customer that are **not referred by** the customer with `id = 2`.

Return the result table in **any order**.

```SQL
SELECT name FROM Customer
WHERE referee_id <> 2 OR referee_id is null
```

Key point: In SQL, a comparison between a `null` value and any other value (including another `null`) using a comparison operator (eg `=`, `!=`, `<`, etc) will result in a `null`, which is considered as `false` for the purposes of a where clause (strictly speaking, it's "not true", rather than "false", but the effect is the same).

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT author_id as id FROM Views 
WHERE author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY id
```

| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the column with unique values for this table.
There are no different rows with the same recordDate.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
```

 

Write a solution to find all dates' `id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in **any order**.

*This question is hard for me as I do not know how to deal with dates and differences.*

```SQL
SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature;
```

### Average Time of Process per Machine

Table: `Activity`

```
+----------------+---------+

| timestamp      | float   |
+----------------+---------+
The table shows the user activities for a factory website.
(machine_id, process_id, activity_type) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) of this table.
machine_id is the ID of a machine.
process_id is the ID of a process running on the machine with ID machine_id.
activity_type is an ENUM (category) of type ('start', 'end').
timestamp is a float representing the current time in seconds.
'start' means the machine starts the process at the given timestamp and 'end' means the machine ends the process at the given timestamp.
The 'start' timestamp will always be before the 'end' timestamp for every (machine_id, process_id) pair.
It is guaranteed that each (machine_id, process_id) pair has a 'start' and 'end' timestamp.
```

 

There is a factory website that has several machines each running the **same number of processes**. Write a solution to find the **average time** each machine takes to complete a process.

The time to complete a process is the `'end' timestamp` minus the `'start' timestamp`. The average time is calculated by the total time to complete every process on the machine divided by the number of processes that were run.

The resulting table should have the `machine_id` along with the **average time** as `processing_time`, which should be **rounded to 3 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

*I could not solve this problem as I am not familiar with sub-queries*

```SQL
SELECT 
    machine_id,
    ROUND(AVG(processing_time), 3) AS processing_time
FROM (
    SELECT 
        machine_id, 
        process_id, 
        MAX(timestamp) - MIN(timestamp) AS processing_time
    FROM Activity
    GROUP BY machine_id, process_id
) AS ProcessTimes
GROUP BY machine_id;
```

Start thinking from the inner one and the larger one.

```SQL
SELECT Employee.name, Bonus.bonus 
FROM Employee LEFT JOIN Bonus ON Employee.empID = Bonus.empID
WHERE bonus is NULL OR bonus < 1000;
```

### Students and Examinations

Table: `Students`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| student_id    | int     |
| student_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
student_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID and the name of one student in the school.
```

```

 

Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

I did not solve this problem, so I copied from solutions

```SQL
SELECT 
    S.student_id,
    S.student_name,
    SU.subject_name,
    COUNT(E.student_id) attended_exams
FROM 
    Students S
CROSS JOIN 
    Subjects SU 
LEFT JOIN 
    Examinations E ON S.student_id=E.student_id AND SU.subject_name = E.subject_name
GROUP BY S.student_id, S.student_name, SU.subject_name
ORDER BY S.student_id, S.student_name, SU.subject_name
;
```

Points to remember:

1. `CROSS JOIN` can join tables without common fields. 
2. Before using `COUNT`, make sure we understand the groups.

### Managers with at Least 5 Direct Reports

Table: `Employee`

```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| department  | varchar |

+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name of an employee, their department, and the id of their manager.
If managerId is null, then the employee does not have a manager.
No employee will be the manager of themself.
```

 

Write a solution to find managers with at least **five direct reports**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

My answer:

```SQL
SELECT name 
FROM Employee
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT managerID, COUNT(*) direct_report
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerID
) AS temp
ON Employee.id = temp.managerID
WHERE direct_report >= 5 
```

More concise answer from solutions:

```SQL
SELECT e.name
FROM Employee AS e 
INNER JOIN Employee AS m ON e.id=m.managerId 
GROUP BY m.managerId 
HAVING COUNT(m.managerId) >= 5
```

### Confirmation Rate

Table: `Signups`

```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
```

 

Table: `Confirmations`

```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').
```

 

The **confirmation rate** of a user is the number of `'confirmed'` messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is `0`. Round the confirmation rate to **two decimal** places.

Write a solution to find the **confirmation rate** of each user.

Return the result table in **any order**.

I copied this answer from the solutions. The only thing I did not figure out is `round(avg(if(c.action="confirmed",1,0)),2)`.

```SQL
SELECT S.user_id, round(avg(if(c.action="confirmed",1,0)),2) confirmation_rate
FROM Signups S
LEFT JOIN Confirmations C
ON S.user_id=C.user_id
GROUP BY S.user_id;
```

Points:

1. This `IF` function can create a column from the action column! This basically replaces the strings with integers
2. The author cleverly converted the problem of calculating rates into calculating the average of 0's and 1's.

Table: `Cinema`

```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+

+---------------+---------+
(product_id, start_date, end_date) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the price of the product_id in the period from start_date to end_date.
For each product_id there will be no two overlapping periods. That means there will be no two intersecting periods for the same product_id.

+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| product_id    | int     |

from (
select p.product_id, p.price, u.units
from Prices p
left join UnitsSold u
on p.product_id=u.product_id and p.start_date <= u.purchase_date and u.purchase_date <= p.end_date
) as n
group by product_id;

| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
```

 

We define query `quality` as:

> The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define `poor query percentage` as:

> The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each `query_name`, the `quality` and `poor_query_percentage`.

Both `quality` and `poor_query_percentage` should be **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Return the result table in **any order**.

    round(avg(rating/position), 2) as quality,
    round(avg(if(rating < 3, 1, 0))*100, 2) as poor_query_percentage
from Queries
group by query_name;
```

### Monthly Transactions I

Table: `Transactions`

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| country       | varchar |

    country,
    count(*) as trans_count,
    sum(if(state='approved', 1, 0)) as approved_count,
    sum(amount) as trans_total_amount,
    sum(amount * if(state='approved', 1, 0)) as approved_total_amount 
from Transactions 
group by country, month;
```

I learned a new function here: `date_format(trans_date, '%Y-%m')` changed from the regular date to only year and month.

### Immediate Food Delivery II

| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the column of unique values of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

 

If the customer's preferred delivery date is the same as the order date, then the order is called **immediate;** otherwise, it is called **scheduled**.

The **first order** of a customer is the order with the earliest order date that the customer made. It is guaranteed that a customer has precisely one first order.

Write a solution to find the percentage of immediate orders in the first orders of all customers, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

```SQL
select round(avg(order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)*100, 2) as immediate_percentage 
from Delivery
where (customer_id, order_date) in (
    select customer_id, min(order_date) # find the order date of the first order
    from Delivery
    group by customer_id
);
```

Point: Remember where in statement (use with subquery)

### Game Play Analysis IV

Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on someday using some device.
```

 

Write a solution to report the **fraction** of players that logged in again on the day after the day they first logged in, **rounded to 2 decimal places**. In other words, you need to count the number of players that logged in for at least two consecutive days starting from their first login date, then divide that number by the total number of players.

```SQL
select round(count(distinct player_id) / (select count(distinct player_id) from Activity), 2) as fraction
from Activity 
where (player_id, event_date - interval 1 day) in (
    select player_id, min(event_date) from Activity group by player_id # find the first login date
);
```

Points:

1. where in statement (use with subquery)
2. The arithmetic with dates are different.
